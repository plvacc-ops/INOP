\subsubsection{Controlled Airspace}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item Controlled Area from FL95 to FL660 --- class ``C'' airspace,
    \item TMA, CTR --- below FL95 --- class ``C'' or ``D'' --- see ENR 2.1.1 or AD 2,
    \item MTMA, MCTR --- class ``D'' --- see ENR 2.1.1 or AD2,
    \item airspaces delegated to other FIRs --- see ENR 2.1.2
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Uncontrolled Airspace}
Class ``G'' --- includes airspace from GND to FL95 outside of controlled airspace.

\subsubsection{Military Airspace}

Currently, only MCTR Dęblin, MCTR Krzesiny and MTMA Dęblin are simulated on the VATSIM network.

In the absence of vATC responsible for given military airspace, these airspaces are relegated to class G airspace.

The remaining military spaces are not currently simulated and have been relegated to Class G spaces.
