\chapter{Coordination with APP}
\label{chap:acc:coordination}

Unless otherwise specified, ACC controllers conduct initial descent of aircraft
arriving to the TMA in accordance with the guidelines below to ensure
coordinated entry levels into the TMA and to facilitate further work by APP
controllers to achieve appropriate descent profile (depending on the STAR
procedure). Two altitude values are given for each procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item first value (in bold) --- the coordinated level to which the aircraft
  should climb/descend (unless the coordination states otherwise),
\item second value (in italics) --- the maximum level at which the aircraft can
  pass a given point (unless coordination states otherwise). These restrictions
  most often result from SID/STAR restrictions,
\item the "TFR" column --- the altitude at which communication transfer takes
  place.
\end{itemize}

\section{TMA Warszawa}
\label{sec:acc:coordination:Warszawa}

APP Warszawa at TMA Warszawa provides radar control service for Warszawa/Chopin
[EPWA] and Warszawa/Modlin [EPMO], additionally it provides initial approach for
Warszawa/Radom [EPRA] and Łódź/Lublinek [EPLL]. The responsibility of the APP
Warszawa controller includes delegated airspaces CTA01 (FL95 -- FL245), CTA02
(FL225 -- FL245) CTA03 (5500 ft -- FL95) and CTA08 (FL95 -- FL115).
