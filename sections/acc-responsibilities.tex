\label{chap:acc:responsibilities}

The area controller [EPWW\_CTR], in the absence of lower ATC positions [APP,
TWR], shall provide aircraft with:

\begin{itemize}
\item radar control service:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item throughout the EPWW FIR above FL95 (the lowest controlled level is
    FL100),
  \item in TMAs with radar approach (TMA Warszawa, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań) below
    FL95, to the lower boundary of class C or D airspace.
  \end{itemize}
\item procedural control service:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item in controlled airspace where radar service is not provided (TMA/CTRs
    without radar service).
  \end{itemize}
\item Flight Information Service (FIS) in G-class airspace below the controlled airspace.
\end{itemize}

The radar service and the procedural control service, along with a description
of the correct techniques for performing each service, are described in detail
in \cref{ch:app:methods}.

\subsubsection{ACC controller tasks}

\begin{itemize}
\item separation of aircraft in airspace,
\item maintaining efficient and orderly air traffic flow,
\item providing necessary tips and information for safe and efficient flights,
\item coordination of air traffic with APP and TWR controllers and neighboring ACCs,
\item whenever possible, providing flight information services below the controlled zone (in G-class airspace) within the horizontal boundaries of the occupied sector.
\end{itemize}
